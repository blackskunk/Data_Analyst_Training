The evaluation illustrates the distribution and characteristics of craters on Mars, divided by geographical quadrants and specific lines (Equator and Prime Meridian). Data indicate significant differences in the number, size, and average area of craters across regions.

Quadrant 2 (Q2) hosts the highest number of craters, accounting for 31.78% of total craters, and also features the largest average crater area and the biggest crater (1164.22 kmÂ²). This may suggest geological or climatic conditions favoring crater formation or preservation in this area.

Quadrants 1 (Q1) and 3 (Q3) also display a high number of craters and average areas, hinting at similar conditions to Q2 or a widespread distribution of impact events across much of Mars.

In contrast, Quadrant 4 (Q4) shows fewer craters and a smaller average crater area, which could indicate different surface conditions or fewer past impact events.

The very low figures at the Equator and Prime Meridian, with only 7 and 3 craters respectively, reveal almost no craters along these specific lines, possibly due to geographical features or data collection limitations.

Overall, the results suggest an uneven distribution of craters on Mars, potentially influenced by factors such as impact frequency, geological activity, and crater preservation.
