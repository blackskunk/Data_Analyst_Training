## Purpose

This post marks the initiation of a series concerning my studies within the "Data Management and Visualization" course at Wesleyan University. 

During the course I will learn to develop a research question based on existing data, describe the variables and their relationships, calculate basic statistics and present the results clearly. 
By the end of the course, I will be able to use Python to manage and visualize data, including dealing with missing data, groups of variables and charts.
