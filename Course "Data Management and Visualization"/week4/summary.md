## Analysis of the results (Screenshot)

The provided table presents data on the distribution of craters on Mars across different quadrants, including the number of craters, their percentage representation, average crater area, as well as the sizes of the largest and smallest craters within each quadrant.

The Northeast Quadrant (Q1_NE) exhibits the highest number of craters, with 88,256 craters, representing approximately 22.96% of the total. The average crater area in this quadrant is 52.24 square kilometers, with the largest crater measuring 408.23 kilometers in diameter.

In the Southeast Quadrant (Q2_SE), there are 122,141 craters, constituting around 31.78% of the total. This quadrant has the largest average crater area among all quadrants, standing at 85.08 square kilometers. The largest crater in this quadrant measures 1,164.22 kilometers in diameter.

The Southwest Quadrant (Q3_SW) contains 111,306 craters, representing approximately 28.96% of the total. Similar to the Southeast Quadrant, it has a relatively large average crater area of 78.77 square kilometers, with the largest crater measuring 1,096.65 kilometers in diameter.

The Northwest Quadrant (Q4_NW) has the lowest number of craters, with 62,630 craters, accounting for approximately 16.30% of the total. The average crater area in this quadrant is 37.26 square kilometers, and the largest crater measures 376.35 kilometers in diameter.

The Equator and Prime Meridian exhibit significantly fewer craters compared to the other quadrants, with 7 and 3 craters, respectively. Their representation percentages are minimal, at 0.002% and 0.001%, respectively. The average crater areas for these regions are 6.35 square kilometers and 3.29 square kilometers, with the largest craters measuring 5.33 kilometers and 2.85 kilometers in diameter, respectively.

Overall, the data highlights variations in crater distribution and size across different quadrants of Mars, providing insights into the geological characteristics and impact history of the planet.
