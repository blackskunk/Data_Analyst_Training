The analysis of the Mars craters dataset reveals a distinct distribution of craters across different quadrants and special lines on Mars. The dataset, after removing rows with empty contents to ensure accuracy and reliability, encompasses a total analysis across four main quadrants (NE, SE, SW, NW) and two special lines (Equator and Prime Meridian).

The highest number of craters is observed in the SE quadrant with 122,141 craters, accounting for approximately 31.78% of the total, and also exhibits the largest average crater area of 85.08 km². This quadrant also contains the largest crater measured at 1164.22 km², indicating a region with significant geological activity or lesser erosion processes compared to others. Following the SE quadrant, the SW quadrant has 111,306 craters, making up nearly 28.96% of the total, with a substantial average crater area of 78.77 km². The NE quadrant, with 88,256 craters, contributes to 22.96% of the total, showcasing a moderate average crater area of 52.24 km². The NW quadrant, despite having the smallest share of craters at 16.30% (62,630 craters), presents a lower average crater area of 37.26 km², suggesting smaller or possibly older craters subjected to more erosion.

Interestingly, the Equator and Prime Meridian lines host a minimal number of craters, with only 7 and 3 craters, respectively, highlighting a negligible impact rate or high erosion rates that erase craters over time in these regions.

The decision to remove data with empty contents was crucial to this analysis, ensuring that the statistics reflect only verifiable and complete information, thereby enhancing the study's integrity. This meticulous approach underscores the significance of data quality in conducting planetary geological studies, facilitating a more accurate understanding of Mars' surface and its crater distribution.
